# WELCOME TO VINOTE!

Vinote is a social experience app for wine enthusiasts to share their favorite wine, and the memories that accompanied them.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The discovery of a new wine can happen anywhere and at anytime, but the experience is always somewhat unique to the individual. Whether the discovery was made on a winery tour at Napa, at your friend’s wedding, over a business deal, out with friends or even at a tasting at your local store there’s always something about the experience (Where we were, who we were with) that fuels our memory of a great wine and a great time.

Vinote is the best way to capture and share your experience when you discover a new wine, and easily sets you up to share the news with your circle of friends or on social media. In our next release, Vinote will also remind you of and help you celebrate those special occasions you experienced and ask you if your would like to send a gift of wine to the people you experienced it with.

## PROJECT MANAGEMENT

We follow SCRUM protocols and met for 15 minutes a day to discuss the achievements, the day ahead, and any obstacles we were encountering. GIT PROJECTS was utilized to manage tasks and assignments, and we operated on a FEATURE BRANCH GIT WORKFLOW.

## ABOUT THE DEPLOYMENT:

The back-end of our App is a Node, Express, and Mongoose API with two models that include a schema for Users and one for Wines. It follows RESTful architecture in the naming and functionality of all available endpoints.  Create, Read, Update, and Destroy functionality is built-in throughout the app. It was then deployed with the following platforms:

HEROKU:
The back-end is a crucial part of most apps. It's used in operations involving routing, requests, and data. And, as you know, Heroku is a service that lets you get a back-end app up-and-running quickly.  Through this project, we realized the strengths Hiroku has in a fairly simple approach to set up and ease of use from within the editing environment

MONGO DB ATLAS:
MongoDB is a solid application platform for database management and analysis. It integrates easily with other platforms and supports transactional, search, analytics, and mobile use cases while using a common query interface and familiar data models.

POSTMAN:
Postman is a great tool that significantly simplified working with an API. It allows for the use variables so that the same request works whether it's in the testing or staging environment, and also allows for the creation of automated API tests.  It was a helpful tool to test the backend before the front end was developed.

NETLIFY (Front-end) 
Utilized for it's speed and simplicity, and thorough code validation, for deploying the front end.  It is also highly compatible with GitHub.
